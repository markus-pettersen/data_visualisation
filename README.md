# Exploratory Data Analysis reports
This repository contains a selection of explatory data analysis (EDA) reports that I have written. The reports contain
data visualisations and analysis from some well known datasets from Kaggle. 

There are currently two reports:
* Automobiles
* Diabetes

## Installation
Both reports are in pdf format. The Jupyter Notebook files are also included. For these, the following modules are required:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Pyplot from matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Missingno

### Additional modules
In addition, Automobiles requires the following:
* Statsmodel

Diabetes requires:
* Scipy

## Usage
The reports are available in pdf format. Jupyter Notebooks are also provided. Details and explations for each stage are given in the markdown cells.

## Credits
